            <p>Welcome to Recipe-Hack. This website is the online implementation of my Final Year project at the University of
              Sussex.</p>

            <p>The goal of this project was to develop an application that could generate a random sandwich recipe by
              implementing a search heuristic known as a genetic algorithm. This will model the effects of evolution
              to 'breed' existing recipes together and create whole new generations of them.</p>

            <p>If you are interested, feel free to ask for your own recipe to be generated by
              <%= link_to 'clicking here', new_recipe_path %> or check out a list of all our existing ready-generated
              recipes by <%= link_to 'clicking here', recipes_path %></p>

            <p>An example of what we can output can be seen below with a randomly chosen recipe from our database.</p>
